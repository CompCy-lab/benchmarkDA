#' DAseq: Detecting regions of differential abundance between scRNA-seq datasets
#'
#' @description DA-seq is a multiscale approach for detecting DA subpopulations.
#' In contrast to clustering based approaches, our method can detect DA subpopulations that do not form
#' well separated clusters.
#' For each cell, we compute a multiscale differential abundance score measure.
#' These scores are based on the k nearest neighbors in the transcriptome space for various values of k.
